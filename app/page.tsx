// app/page.tsx — the home page.
//
// Redesigned September 2026, built and reviewed on /home-page-test first.
//
//   - The previous page was 21,482px (about 28 laptop screens) with 17
//     sections and ONE lead form, in the hero. This one is roughly half the
//     length with three forms: the hero, after the results, and the close.
//   - The hero is unchanged (HeroV2): founder's face and name on the form card,
//     both fields visible, proof and a phone number on the first screen.
//   - Results as evidence cards: SMK before/after, the MSO setback-fix-recovery
//     story with its revenue, D.O.L.L.S. and Remit Choice. The long versions
//     live on the case study pages.
//   - Law firms / local businesses / ecommerce as one tabbed section. Every
//     panel is in the HTML, so all of its links stay crawlable.
//   - One visual system (Inter, 24px cards, pill controls, one action colour)
//     and no reveal-on-scroll animations, which shipped content at opacity 0.
//   - The chat widget and the sticky mobile CTA are kept, as on the old page.
//
// Every figure is read from app/case-studies (data.ts and details.ts), the
// proof components or lib/pricing — never typed here.

    a: `${local ? `Local SEO runs ${formatRange(local)} a month` : ""}${law ? `, law firm SEO ${formatRange(law)}` : ""}${ecom ? ` and ecommerce SEO ${formatRange(ecom)}` : ""}. The price depends on how many pages, locations or practice areas you need. It is month to month, and the free tear-down comes first.`,
  },
  {
    q: "How long does SEO take to show results?",
    a: "Local results can start moving within weeks once the profile and pages are fixed. One HVAC client was named in Google's AI Overview for its core search. Competitive and ecommerce work usually takes three to six months. The tear-down gives you a realistic read for your market.",
  },
  {
    q: "Who actually does the work?",
    a: "Mubashar Sharif, the founder — every audit, page and report. There are no account managers or juniors, which is also why SearchPrex takes one client per city.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you get my business into Google's AI Overviews & ChatGPT Search?",
    a: "Yes. I put a short, direct answer under each question on your pages, so ChatGPT, Gemini and Google AI Overviews can quote it. I add schema markup so they know who you are. And I keep an llms.txt file that points AI tools to your best pages.",
  },
  {
    q: "What free SEO intelligence and diagnostic tools does SearchPrex provide?",
    a: "Yes, all free. There is a domain authority checker, a SERP simulator and a schema generator. There are also SEO checklists, dated SEO news and a library of fixes for common problems.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you guarantee rankings?",
    a: "No, and nobody honestly can — Google decides rankings. What I do guarantee is progress. If you see no measurable progress in 90 days, I keep working for free, or refund those 90 days. You also get the tear-down in 24 hours, the work done by me, and a plain report every Monday.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I have to sign a contract?",
    a: "No. SearchPrex runs month to month — no annual contract, no lock-in. You start with a free 7-day trial, then pay monthly only while the work is producing results. If you don't see measurable progress in 90 days, those 90 days are refunded.",
  },
  {
    q: "Where is SearchPrex based?",

                  I work from Pakistan, on US business hours. I chose law firms, local businesses and online stores for one reason. I kept seeing good businesses pay for SEO reports every month while the phone stayed quiet. So I do the work myself, for fewer clients. Judge me on calls and signed cases, not rankings. If I can&apos;t show progress in 90 days, you don&apos;t pay for those 90 days.
